        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>The CARS-ANTI-CATS (CAC) system is an innovative solution designed to prevent stray cats from seeking warmth under car engines, reducing accidents and ensuring the safety of both cats and vehicles. The system uses infrared sensors to detect cats and emits harmless sound waves to deter them. This project combines technology and empathy to address a significant community concern.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <img src="CARS_ANTI_CATS_SCHEMATIC.png" alt="CARS-ANTI-CATS System Diagram">
        <p>The system is powered by car batteries and features infrared sensors for precise detection. Ultrasonic emitters were calibrated after extensive testing to ensure the safety and comfort of the cats, balancing effectiveness and welfare.</p>

        <p>Beyond the technical solution, this project involved active collaboration with the local community. Through presentations in residential groups and discussions with frequent feeders of stray cats, I garnered support and ideas. With permission from property management, insulated shelters were placed in approved locations.</p>
        <p>The results have been remarkable: no incidents of stray cats being found in underground garages this winter, and the stray cat population has been significantly controlled. Of the original 11 frequent strays, only 3 remain in the neighborhood, safely housed in the provided shelters, while others have found loving homes through adoption drives.</p>

        <h2>Impact and Vision</h2>
        <p>The CARS-ANTI-CATS project highlights the power of combining technology and compassion to solve real-world problems. It reflects the importance of shared concerns driving collective action and showcases how innovation can be used to create sustainable solutions.</p>
        <p>My hope is to inspire others to think critically and creatively about the challenges in their communities, finding ways to make a tangible, positive impact.</p>
